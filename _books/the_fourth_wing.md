**Blurb**

At Basgiath War College, only the strongest dragon riders survive training. Violet Sorrengail was meant for a quiet life of scribing—until her war-hero mother orders her into the deadly rider quadrant. Think *Hunger Games* meets *How to Train Your Dragon* with a healthy dose of romance and military drama.

**Why it’s on my list**

Explosive TikTok buzz, nonstop hold queues at my library, and promises of sarcastic banter + fearsome dragons. Sounds like the perfect adrenaline fix after **ACOTAR**.

**Expectations**

Fast pacing, a brutal magic-school vibe, and cliff-hanger ending that’ll send me straight to *Iron Flame*.

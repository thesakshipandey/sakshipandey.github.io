**Blurb**

Feyre is a 19-year-old huntress who kills a wolf in the woods and is dragged into the faerie realm of Prythian as punishment—only to discover her captor’s world is not what it seems. A seductive Beauty-and-the-Beast retelling packed with dangerous magic, slow-burn romance, and court intrigue.

**Why I picked it**

Wanted to see why the **ACOTAR** series dominates BookTok and test the hype around Sarah J. Maas’s fae romances.

**First impressions**

The opening feels YA-grim, but the world-building ramps quickly once Feyre crosses the wall. Curious to track the shift from survival thriller to high-court politics.

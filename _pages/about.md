Hey there! I’m [Sakshi](#) 👋🏻, a Master’s student at [IIT Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in), diving deep into the fascinating world of `Computer Science`. My current obsessions? Building `recommendation systems` that genuinely understand human preferences — think `personalized conversational agents` — and tackling the ever-evolving puzzle of `prompt optimization`.

My journey so far has been a bit of a whirlwind (just the way I like it!). I’ve dabbled in using reinforcement learning to tackle `side-channel attacks`, `red-teamed LLMs` to explore their quirks, worked on `signboard OCR`, and even played around with `scene graph` structures. I’m definitely someone who loves having a few exciting projects cooking at once!

I live for that spark of learning something new every day.  
Working on something cool in `AI/ML` (or just want to geek out over books or food)?

### Outside the lab--

When my brain isn’t buzzing with code or papers, you’ll likely find me:

- Lost in a fantasy novel (team [Sarah J. Maas](https://sarahjmaas.com/) & [Rebecca Yarros](https://rebeccayarros.com/)) 
- 🎮 Gaming or solving tricky puzzles  
- 🍜 Chasing down new cuisines — yes, I’m a proud **foodie on a lifelong quest**
